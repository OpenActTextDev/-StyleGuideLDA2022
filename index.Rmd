It is important for chapters in the *Open Actuarial Textbooks* project to have a consistent look and feel. The *Style Guide for Loss Data Analytics* aims to assist contributors in developing chapters consistently throughout the *Loss Data Analytics* book. 

The first three chapters will be useful for authors revising chapters in 2022.

The second three chapters are more geared for the development of new chapters or new open actuarial textbooks.
